# Node processing test
- To start the project, firstly run
    - ```npm install```
- Then run
    - ```node index.js```
    - This will output three json files in the /files/output/ directory in the root folder
- To run the tests
    - ```npm run test```

# Improvements to be made
- Firstly, if I spent enough time on the tasks, I would of added typescript to them. Strongly defined types would of been really handy
- Adding more unit tests - as all of the functions are seperated, it would be possible to be able to individually test all of the tasks seperately
- A better folder structure, adding services / classes.
- Potentially using js `reduce()` function to make some of the code cleaner
